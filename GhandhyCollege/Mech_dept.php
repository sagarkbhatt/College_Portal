                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mechanical Department is having well equipped Thermal Engineering, Dynamics, Hydraulics, Modern workshop, Metrology, Metallurgy, Production, Industrial, Automobile, Refrigeration & Air - Conditioning, Alternate sources of Energy, Heat transfer and Computer laboratories.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The department is also having two Drawing halls for the drawing practices. The Department is having Cochran Boiler in working condition. All the laboratories are having latest models and charts to facilitated the teaching work. Department is having computer facility with two Pentium PC’s. The Department have planned for the improvement of the Computer laboratory</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Good economy of a country leads to better future and it relies largely on total productivity, which is highly dependent on mechanical engineers. After establishment of Government Polytechnic, Mechanical Engineering Department comes in to existence in 1958, with initial intake of 30 students per year with semester system. Looking to the present requirement of the diploma engineers institute has increased the intake capacity to 120 student per year in the regular diploma stream. In addition to this looking present trend of distance learning , Director of technical Education has introduce Distance learning programme for Mechanical engineering branch. At present total intake capacity of DL Mode is 30 students per year.
